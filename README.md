<details>
  <summary><b>More indepth details about the PiKVM features</b></summary>

## Fully-featured and modern IP-KVM
* **Cheaper, but better than commercial solutions**  
  Costs between $30 and $100 depending on the features desired. Even the most expensive configuration will be cheaper than a $500 commercial IP-KVM.
* **Easy to build - For the v0 variant**  
  A ready-to-use OS that can be created just by running `make build` and installed to an SD-card using `make install`. The hardware can be made in half an hour and without soldering.
* **The widest hardware support**  
  There are many ways to build a PiKVM. Video capture devices can be attached using the CSI-2 or USB interfaces. Raspberry Pi models 2, 3, 4, ZeroW or Zero2W may be used. Any combination of hardware is supported, and PiKVM implements the maximum possible set of features.
* **Very low latency**  
  ~100 milliseconds of video latency. This is the smallest delay of all existing solutions.
* **Extra lightweight and fancy Web UI**  
  No weird proprietary clients. No ugly Java applets. Just use your favorite browser to connect to the PiKVM. No flash plugins either!
* **Keyboard and mouse**  
  Mouse usage works directly in the browser. The keyboard emulator supports displaying the state of the keyboard LEDs.
* **Mass Storage Drive**  
  On the Raspberry Pi 4, ZeroW and Zero2W, PiKVM can emulate a virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive. A live image can be uploaded to boot the attached server.
* **ATX power management**  
  With a very simple circuit that can be assembled on a breadboard, the power button of the attached server can be controlled using the ATX button headers on the motherboard.
* **Security**  
  PiKVM can be opened to the Internet and no one will get access without the password. SSL is used to protect traffic from being intercepted by third parties.
* **Local monitoring**  
  PiKVM monitors the health of the Raspberry Pi board and will warn you if it's too hot or is not receiving enough power.
* **GPIO management**
  You can control GPIO and USB relays via the web interface. The extensible interface allows you to make anything out of it.

## Production-ready  
* **Linux-based embedded OS**  
  The PiKVM OS is based on [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org) and can be customized for any needs. Thousands of pre-built binary packages are at your service and can be updated with a single command!
* **Read-only filesystem**  
  By default the OS runs in read-only mode, as an embedded system should. This prevents damage to the memory card due to a sudden power outage.
* **VNC server**  
  The managed server and its BIOS can be accessed using a regular VNC client which supports JPEG compression.
* **IPMI BMC and Redfish**  
  Use `ipmitool`, `ipmiutil` or any existing network infrastructure that supports IPMI to monitor and manage the server's power. Redfish and `redfishtool` supported too.
* **Wake-on-LAN**  
  PiKVM can be configured to power up a managed server using WoL. This will be available in the Web menu.
* **Extensible authorization methods**  
  Multiple PiKVMs can be configured to use a [common authorization service](https://github.com/pikvm/kvmd-auth-server). PAM and its rich authorization mechanisms can also be used to integrate PiKVM into your existing authentication infrastructure.
* **Macro scripts**  
  If repetitive actions must be performed on the attached server (or on several different servers), a macro can be recorded with keyboard & mouse actions and can be played back multiple times.


## Open Source
* **Community & support**  
  PiKVM has a large community. Join the [discord chat](https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5) if you have any questions.
* **Extensible**  
  PiKVM was designed as a set of microservices with a plug-in architecture. It's very easy to modify and maintain.
* **Comprehensive API**  
  Everything that can be done via the user interface can also be done via a powerful HTTP API.
* **Know-how**  
  We created [our very own MJPG video server](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer) written in C with multi-threading support and GPU video encoding - the fastest streaming solution available to provide the best video quality for PiKVM. We also tested a lot of hardware configurations so that you can be sure devices you assemble will work reliably.

# DIY Getting Started
## Required hardware
PiKVM supports several different hardware configurations, referred to as **platforms**. Now available: **v2** and **v0**.
* **Recommended**: **v2** is the most modern implementation for **Raspberry Pi 4**, **ZeroW** and **Zero2W** supporting all of the features of PiKVM including the **Mass Storage Drive**. **For Raspberry Pi 4 and Zero2W (not for ZeroW), there is support for H.264 video.**. **It's also the easiest to make**.
* v0 was designed to work with Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 that do not have OTG and requires a few more components for a basic implementation. It also does not support the Mass Storage Drive feature.

## Hardware for v2
* Raspberry Pi board:
  - **Recommended**: Raspberry Pi 4 (2 GB model is enough) for the best performance. However, the 1Gb models will also work.
  - ... or Raspberry Pi Zero2W (no ethernet).
  - ... or Raspberry Pi ZeroW (slower alternative, no ethernet).
* MicroSD card (min 16 GB recommended).
* USB-A 3A charger (female socket) or official rpi recommended power supply.
* Video capture device:
  - **Recommended**: [HDMI to CSI-2 bridge based on TC358743](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000102166176.html) - low latency, more reliable, **H.264 video**.
  - ... or [HDMI to USB dongle](https://aliexpress.com/item/4001043540669.html) (not available for ZeroW and Zero2W) - high latency >200ms, [not very reliable](#a-few-words-about-hdmi-usb-dongle-h264-is-not-officially-supported-at-this-time)), H.264 is not supported.
* Only for Raspberry Pi 4: parts for Y-splitter cable (**one variant at your choice**):

    </ul>
    </details>
    

* Only for Raspberry Pi ZeroW and Zero2W:
  * 2x USB A-to-micro cables (male-male, for power and keyboard & mouse emulator). A power splitter OR a modded cable is required for this 2x usb configuration. 1x USB A-to-Micro is ONLY needed for direct connection to the target.
  * 1x [Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cable](https://aliexpress.com/item/32953696917.html) (if using HDMI to CSI-2 Bridge, but not compatible with Auvidea B101, check pinout).
* For ATX control (optional):
  - [4x MOSFET relays OMRON G3VM-61A1](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=G3VM-61A1).
  - 4x 390 Ohm resistors.
  - 2x 4.7k Ohm resistors.
  - A breadboard and wires.
  
#### A few words about HDMI-USB dongle (H.264 is NOT officially supported at this time)
The dongle is completely supported and PiKVM works great with it. But it has some disadvantages compared with recommended [HDMI-CSI bridge](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000102166176.html): USB gives a lot of latency (200ms vs 100ms for MJPEG) and it doesn't support stream compression control (you won't be able to use PiKVM in a place with a poor internet connection). There is no H.264 support at the moment. It also cannot automatically detect screen resolution. All this is caused by the hardware limitations of the dongle itself. In addition, some users report hardware problems: the dongle may not work in the BIOS or simply stop working after a while. It's a black box, and no one knows what's inside it. If you have problems with it, it will not be possible to fix them.
  
## Hardware for v0
* Raspberry Pi 2 or 3.
* MicroSD card (8 GB is enough).
* USB-A 3A charger (female socket) or power supply.
* For keyboard & mouse emulator (HID):
  - Arduino Pro Micro (based on an ATMega32u4).
  - [Logic level shifter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009).
  - 1x NPN transistor (almost any NPN transistor: 2n2222 or similar).
  - 1x 390 Ohm resistor.
  - A breadboard and wires.
* 2x USB A-to-micro cables (male-male, for power and HID).
* HDMI capture device: [see v2 description](#hardware-for-v2).
* ATX control (optional): [see v2 description](#hardware-for-v2).

#### Addition
* If you want to capture VGA from your server instead of HDMI, buy the [VGA-to-HDMI converter](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000553298530.html).
* PiKVM can be powered using PoE, but it is not recommend to use the official PoE HAT: it is unreliable and [not compatible with the HDMI bridge](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/6). Use any other PoE hat without an I2C fan controller.
* **Don't use random relay modules or random optocouplers!** Some relays or optocouplers may not be sensitive enough for the Raspberry Pi, some others may be low-level controlled. Either use relays that are activated by a high logic level, or follow the design provided and buy an OMRON. See details [here](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/13).

# Setting up the hardware
## Connecting the video capture
#### For the HDMI-CSI bridge
<details>
  <summary>:exclamation:Click to show the instructions:exclamation:</summary>
Insert the flexible flat cable of the HDMI bridge into the narrow white connector on the Raspberry Pi (the closest one to big USB sockets). It is labeled CAMERA. To insert you need to open the connector first. On the Raspberry Pi side you can gently lift the black part up and a little bit sideways:

| Opening the MIPI CSI-2 slot on the Raspberry Pi                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikvm/pikvm/master/img/open-MIPI-CSI2-Slot.png" alt="detailed picture of the MIPI-CSI2 slot" width="350"> |

For the HDMI-CSI bridge it depends on the version you bought. Either pull it gently up as on the Raspberry or push it sideways. Make sure that the cable is inserted on the correct side and until it stops, and then push the black latch back. Never connect or disconnect the flat cable from a powered device. This is not Plug-and-Play, and you can damage it. Also use only the cable that was included with the device package, or make sure that the third-party cable has the correct pinout.

#### For the HDMI-USB dongle
<details>
  <summary>:exclamation:Click to show the instructions:exclamation:</summary>
Connect USB dongle to exactly this port. It is bound in the software so the OS does not confuse the video device with something else.

There are many revisions of the Raspberry Pi boards and you may come across one that we haven't tested. If the binding fails, the device will be available for all ports. Everything will work, but if you use a webcam and Linux mistakes it for a dongle, [write to us](https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5) and we will fix it.

## Setting up the v2
<details>
  <summary>:exclamation:Click to show the instructions:exclamation:</summary>
Here is a diagram shows that how to connect all of the pieces (click to full size).

**Raspberry Pi 4**: since one USB-C female connector is used to receive power and perform keyboard/mouse/drive emulation a special Y-cable must be made that splits the DATA and POWER lines of USB-C (see [reasons](https://github.com/pikvm/docs/issues/11)). It can be made from two suitable connecting cables, or soldered together from scratch. Be sure to check the circuit diagram below, otherwise you may damage your devices. The appropriate USB pinout(s) can easily be found on Google. Please note that if you make a Y-cable from two no-name cables, the colors of the wires may not match those shown. Use a multimeter to make sure the connections are correct.

**Raspberry Pi Zero (2) W**: This board has two USB micro connectors: one for power supply, the second for emulating a USB OTG device. You need to prevent backpowering as in the RPi4 case. To do this, you need to cut off the red power wire in the OTG wire, or seal the +5v pin in the USB-A connector with electrical tape like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikvm/pikvm/master/img/v2_tape_off.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

# The final steps
1. [Flash the operating system](https://docs.pikvm.org/flashing_os).
2. **Carefully read [the "First steps" guide](https://docs.pikvm.org/first_steps)** - how to find a device on the network, how to log in there, change passwords, and so on. **Follow the steps described there and come back here**.
3. V0 only: [flash the Arduino HID](https://docs.pikvm.org/flashing_hid).
4. **Learn about the [basics of working with PiKVM](https://docs.pikvm.org/first_steps) and CHANGE THE PASSWORDS**
5. Note for the HDMI-USB dongle:
    <details>
      <summary>:exclamation:Click to show:exclamation:</summary>

      Many USB video capture devices tell the server's video card that the HDMI cable is supposedly disconnected. This may lead to the fact that if you boot the server without an active stream, the server will not detect your capture card. This is easy to fix:
      * Switch filesystem to RW-mode:
        ```
        # rw
        ```
      * Edit file `/etc/kvmd/override.yaml` and add these lines:
        ```yaml
        kvmd:
            streamer:
                forever: true
                cmd_append: [--slowdown]
        ```
      * Finish:
        ```
        # ro
        # systemctl restart kvmd
        ```
