description: How to configure the access to your PiKVM using Tailscale VPN
---

The [Tailscale VPN](https://tailscale.com/) can be used to access PiKVM
from the Internet if configuring [port forwarding](port_forwarding.md)
is not possible or more security is desired. Tailscale is a convenient
and free (for private use) tool for organizing a small VPN network.

The basic Tailscale configuration commands are shown below. For detailed
instructions, refer to [Tailscale
support](https://tailscale.com/contact/support/).

-----

## Configuring the PiKVM

1. Update OS:

    {!_update_os.md!}

2. Install the Tailscale client, run `tailscaled` service and register it in the network:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# rw
    # If you were afraid to pikvm-update above first run pacman -Syy
    [root@pikvm ~]# pacman -S tailscale-pikvm
    [root@pikvm ~]# systemctl enable --now tailscaled
    [root@pikvm ~]# tailscale up
    ```

3. Follow the link to authorize this installation.
    You likely want to [disable key expiry](https://tailscale.com/kb/1028/key-expiry/)!

4. After authorization success, reboot to make sure that everything works correctly:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# reboot
    ```

5. Now, you can view the IP address of the Tailscale network interface:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# ip addr show tailscale0
    ```

If everything is successful, PiKVM will become a member of your VPN network.

!!! warning "Do not update Tailscale if you don't have access to PiKVM without VPN"
    Unfortunately, sometimes, updating the Tailscale client can cause problems due to
    breaking changes. These are compatibility issues on the Tailscale side.
    Remember this when updating.

## Configuring a client device

* [Download](https://tailscale.com/download) and install the Tailscale client
    to the system you are using (not to the system you want to control).
* Check the [Tailscale admin page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) to view your VPN network.
* Follow the URL in the web browser: `https://<tailscale_kvm_ip>` and you will see the PiKVM web interface.

## Using Tailscale Certificates

PiKVM uses self-signed SSL certificates out of the box. You can also use
[Tailscale certificates](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https) in place of the default one.

!!! warning
    Tailscale certificates are provided by Let's Encrypt and has a default
    [expiry of 90 days](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days/).
    There is currently no mechanism available to auto-renew Tailscale
    certificate. You may put the commands below in a script to simplify
    process.

1. Switch filesystem to RW if in ReadOnly mode and delete existing PiKVM certificates for nginx and vnc.

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# rw
    [root@pikvm ~]# rm -v /etc/kvmd/{nginx,vnc}/ssl/*.{crt,key}
    ```

2. Provision new certificates using [`tailscale cert`](https://tailscale.com/kb/1080/cli#cert)
    command. Optionally you may create a directory to store the certificates.

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# mkdir .cert
    [root@pikvm ~]# cd .cert
    [root@pikvm .cert]# tailscale cert <tailscale_hostname>
    ```

3. Copy the certificates to nginx's and vnc's ssl directories.

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# cp /root/.cert/<tailscale_hostname>.key /etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl/server.key
    [root@pikvm ~]# cp /root/.cert/<tailscale_hostname>.crt /etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl/server.crt
    ```

    Repeat the same steps for vnc if you have configured it.

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# cp /root/.cert/<tailscale_hostname>.key /etc/kvmd/vnc/ssl/server.key
    [root@pikvm ~]# cp /root/.cert/<tailscale_hostname>.crt /etc/kvmd/vnc/ssl/server.crt
    ```

4. Grant file ownership to nginx and vnc services. Switch filesystem to ReadOnly again

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# chown :kvmd-nginx /etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl/*
    [root@pikvm ~]# chown :kvmd-vnc /etc/kvmd/vnc/ssl/*
    [root@pikvm ~]# ro
    ```

5. Restart nginx and vnc services

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# systemctl restart kvmd-nginx
    [root@pikvm ~]# systemctl restart kvmd-vnc
    ```

## Automated Ephemeral Tailscale Certificates Renewal

Tailscale has a nice option of running an HTTPS on your behalf within your tailnet: [`tailscale serve`](https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve). It is using Let's Encrypt certificates and renews them every 90 days. The issue is that PiKVM’s filesystem is read-only. While tailscale will diligently request new certificates, it will fail to write it on the disk and hence will try to request new certificates next time you access your web server. Let's Encrypt has a limit of 5 certificates for the server per week, so you will end up with an inoperable server and rate-limited by Let's Encrypt for a day or so.

Here's the command that allows you to seamlessly run HTTPS proxy for your PiKVM:
```console
[root@pikvm ~]# tailscale serve --bg https+insecure://localhost:443
````
And if you want to stop tailscale from serving HTTPS, you can do this by running:
```console
[root@pikvm ~]# tailscale serve --https=443 off
````

### Root cause
Tailscale needs to refresh TLS certificates and write state under `/var/lib/tailscale`.  
On PiKVM, the root filesystem is read-only, so direct writes fail.  

We can fix this by mounting an **ephemeral overlay filesystem (tmpfs) in RAM** for `/var/lib/tailscale`, backed by a persistent lowerdir (`/root/tailscale-state`).

This ensures that certificate rotation and state writes work without breaking PiKVM’s read-only state.

!!! warning
    The **caveat** is that renewed certificates exist only in RAM. After a reboot, Tailscale falls back to the older certificates on disk, requests fresh ones, and stores them in RAM again.
    If you reboot PiKVM too frequently, this can trigger Let's Encrypt's rate limits.

### Solution

Core idea:
- Mount a **tmpfs** over Tailscale's state folder stored in root's home: /root/tailscale-state. 
- Mount the resulting *merged* layer onto the actual Tailscale state folder at /var/lib/tailscale.
- An **overlayfs** will transparently present this folder to Tailscale, while changes are kept in the RAM-based overlay layer.

**Note**: Overlayfs requires that the upperdir and workdir exist before creating the overlay.
Since these directories live in RAM, they disappear after every reboot.
This means we cannot use fstab to declare the mount points.
Instead, we implement this with a systemd service that runs a setup script during boot, before tailscaled starts.

1. Switch filesystem to RW and copy Tailscale state:

```console
[root@pikvm ~]# rw
[root@pikvm ~]# cp -a /var/lib/tailscale /root/tailscale-state
````

2. Create a helper script, save as `/usr/local/bin/setup-tailscale-overlay.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Make tmpfs for tailscale overlay
mkdir -p /tmp/tailscale-tmpfs
mountpoint -q /tmp/tailscale-tmpfs || mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp/tailscale-tmpfs

# Prepare overlay dirs
mkdir -p /tmp/tailscale-tmpfs/upper
mkdir -p /tmp/tailscale-tmpfs/work
mkdir -p /tmp/tailscale-merged

# Mount overlay (lowerdir = persistent readonly state in /root)
mountpoint -q /tmp/tailscale-merged || mount -t overlay overlay \
  -o lowerdir=/root/tailscale-state,upperdir=/tmp/tailscale-tmpfs/upper,workdir=/tmp/tailscale-tmpfs/work \
  /tmp/tailscale-merged

# Bind merged to /var/lib/tailscale
mountpoint -q /var/lib/tailscale && umount /var/lib/tailscale || true
mount --bind /tmp/tailscale-merged /var/lib/tailscale
```

Make it executable:

```console
[root@pikvm ~]# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup-tailscale-overlay.sh
```

3. Create a systemd unit

We need to run the overlay setup **after `/tmp` is mounted** but **before `tailscaled.service`**.

Save as `/etc/systemd/system/tailscale-overlay.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Setup overlayfs for Tailscale
After=local-fs.target tmp.mount
Before=tailscaled.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/setup-tailscale-overlay.sh
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Notes:**

* `local-fs.target` ensures all local filesystems (including `/tmp` tmpfs from fstab) are mounted.
* `tmp.mount` is added explicitly in case your system defines it.
* Overlay is mounted and bound before `tailscaled` starts.

4. Enable and reload

```console
[root@pikvm ~]# systemctl daemon-reload
[root@pikvm ~]# systemctl enable tailscale-overlay.service
[root@pikvm ~]# ro
```

---

### Boot sequence recap:

1. tmpfs is mounted at `/tmp/tailscale-tmpfs`
2. `upper` + `work` dirs are recreated inside tmpfs
3. overlay is mounted with `/root/tailscale-state` as lowerdir
4. overlay bind-mounted to `/var/lib/tailscale`
5. `tailscaled.service` starts with writable state

-----

## Troubleshooting

* If something does not work, the usual advice is to completely remove Tailscale from PiKVM and perform a clean installation:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# rw
    [root@pikvm ~]# pacman -Rscnd tailscale
    [root@pikvm ~]# rm -rf /var/lib/tailscale /var/cache/tailscale
    [root@pikvm ~]# reboot
    ```

Now, follow the instructions from the beginning to re-install Tailscale.

* In case of certificate issues you can try the following steps to debug and fix.

1. Check if the services are running. If not please start them. For example,
    web UI service can be checked using:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# systemctl status kvmd-nginx
    ```

    For VNC:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# systemctl status kvmd-vnc
    ```

2. If the services are running but not accessible or showing a warning, check
    the respective logs. For web UI:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# journalctl -xeu kvmd-nginx
    ```

3. If the logs shows TLS/certificate/permissions errors, the issue may be with
    file ownership. The services must have at least the group ownership of the
    certificates. The ownership should look similar to this:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# ls -l /etc/kvmd/{nginx,vnc}/ssl
    /etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl:
    total 8
    -r--r--r-- 1 root kvmd-nginx 2872 Jan  3 16:07 server.crt
    -r--r----- 1 root kvmd-nginx  227 Jan  3 16:07 server.key

    /etc/kvmd/vnc/ssl:
    total 8
    -r--r--r-- 1 root kvmd-vnc 2872 Jan  3 16:07 server.crt
    -r--r----- 1 root kvmd-vnc  227 Jan  3 16:07 server.key
    ```
