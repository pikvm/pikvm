!!! info "PiKVM + Multiport Switches compatibility"

	Please note that this switch requires a USB port for control. The following devices can provide this:

	* **DIY** devices based on **Raspberry Pi 2**, **3** and **4**.

	The following devices are not compatible:

	* **PiKVM V4 Mini** - it doesn't have a USB host port and cannot control switches, it's a single-host device.
	* **DIY** based on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - it doesn't have USB host port too.
