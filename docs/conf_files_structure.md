# Structure of configuration files

Most of the PiKVM configuration files are located in the `/etc/kvmd` directory.

The `/etc/kvmd/main.yaml` file defines the platform config and **you should never edit it**. To redefine system parameters use the file `/etc/kvmd/override.yaml`. All other files that are also not recommended for editing have read-only permissions.

In the `/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml` file you can specify some information regarding the host that this PiKVM manages.

!!! tip
    A complete list of all parameters can be viewed using the `kvmd -m` command.

Files with the suffix `*.yaml` uses the [YAML syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)
and describes a parameter tree with key-value pairs of different types.
To define the parameters within one section, an indent of 4 spaces is used.
Comments starts with the `#` symbol.

!!! warning "Only 4 spaces should be used for indentation"
    Be careful when editing YAML and follow this rule.
    Invalid indentation or tabs instead of spaces will cause an error when starting the services.

??? example "Sections under the same keys should be merged"
    * **Wrong:**

        ```yaml
        kvmd:
            gpio:
                drivers: ...
        kvmd:
            gpio:
                scheme: ...
        ```

    * **Correct:**

        ```yaml
        kvmd:
            gpio:
                drivers: ...
                scheme: ...
        ```
