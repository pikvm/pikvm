# H.264 / WebRTC

!! warning "Only main browsers are supported. Chrome/Firefox"

This is a new alternative video transfer mode available for Raspberry Pi 4 users with an HDMI-CSI bridge (including PiKVM v3 HAT).
It uses H.264 encoding instead of MJPEG and provides significantly less traffic consumption. ZeroW is NOT supported.

If you use an OS image built after 2021.06.10, this mode will be available by default.
If you are upgrading to an older version of the OS, you will need to manually enable the WebRTC gateway:

```
# systemctl enable --now kvmd-janus
```

Then reload the Web UI and then in the **System** menu you will see the video mode switch.

!!! note
    If you do not see the switch, it means that either your browser does not support WebRTC, or the `kvmd-janus` service was not started.


## Basics

The MJPEG video stream uses the same HTTP connection that you use to get the web interface.
This means that for remote access, you just need to forward ports 80 and 443 on your router.

In contrast, WebRTC is a completely different way of transmitting video.
It uses a P2P connection and UDP. This reduces network load, but makes it difficult to configure -
the server needs to know your network configuration in order to use it correctly.

To implement this, the PiKVM checks which of the network interfaces is used for the default gateway,
and also tries to find out your external address using the Google [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) server.
This is necessary when using [Tailscale](tailscale.md) or so that you can connect to your PiKVM from the external Internet,
since simply forwarding ports 80 and 443 for WebRTC is not enough - it requires a direct connection.

If you don't like using Google (it was chosen as the default for reliability reasons) for this purpose,
you can choose [any other STUN server](https://www.voip-info.org/stun/) at your discretion, or set up your own.

Edit `/etc/kvmd/override.yaml`:

```yaml
janus:
    stun:
        host: stun.stunprotocol.org
        port: 3478
```

... and restart `kvmd-janus` service using `systemctl restart kvmd-janus`.


## Custom Janus config

[Janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com) is a WebRTC gateway that is used to transmit the [uStreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer) video.
KVMD-Janus is a wrapper around it, configuring and monitoring changes in the network configuration. This is suitable for most users.
However, if your PiKVM is not connected to the Internet and/or you want to use a custom Janus configuration,
then you should use the `kvmd-janus-static` service instead. You should first change the Janus configuration yourself.
You can find it in `/etc/kvmd/janus/janus.jcfg`.

```
# systemctl disable --now kvmd-janus
...
# systemctl enable --now kvmd-janus-static
```


## Troubleshooting

In rare cases, WebRTC may not work. The most common reasons are:

* Tricky IPv6 configuration on the network. IPv6 support for WebRTC in PiKVM is still in its infancy, so if your network has IPv4, it will be easiest to disable IPv6 on PiKVM. To do this, switch the file system to write mode using `rw` command, add option `ipv6.disable_ipv6=1` to `/boot/cmdline.txt` and perform `reboot`. Also see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/IPv6#Disable_IPv6).

* A paranoid firewall when you try to connect to the PiKVM by forwarding port 443 to the Internet from the internal network. WebRTC is not enough of this, it uses UDP on ports 10000-20000 for a P2P connection. Make sure that the Firewall does not block them.

* If nothing helps, open the browser's JS console and look at the log, and contact our community via [Discord](https://discord.gg/bpmXfz5). Developers and/or experienced users will definitely help you.

* Another option to try is if you have both wifi and eth connected, disable wifi `rfkill list wifi` then `rfkill block X` where is a number that shows in the output. Reason: Arch Linux will choose to route all outgoing packets out wifi by default.

* There are some linux distro's that require more work to be able to use H.264 (WEBRTC MODE), this may include any RedHat variant.

    * For instance: On Fedora you can install the rpmfusion repos, then use the `chromium-freeworld` package instead of `chromium`
