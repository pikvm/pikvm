# Cloudflare Tunnels

[Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) can be used to access PiKVM over the internet securely using Cloudflare Zero Trust with Cloudflared. This is a convenient and free (for 50 users) tool for allowing access to web services running on your internal network without port forwarding or IPv4/IPv6 compatability issues. This document is provided as an example for accessing your PiKVM over the internet but you can also use Zerotier/[Tailscale](tailscale.md)/*Insert XYZ VPN service here*. Basic support like whats shown below is provided as an example, any other setting or functionality needs to be redirected to the appropriate community.


## Prequisites
  
1. A domain utilizing Cloudflare for DNS

2. A Cloudflare tunnel configured with an application created and secured by an access policy

3. Custom firewall rules configured in Cloudflare as needed


## Cloudflare Tunnel Steps

1. Login to Cloudflare and provision a tunnel using the steps [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/). Save the tunnel token as we will need this later. In most cases the target will be https://localhost 

2. Create a self-hosted application with the URL matching one created in the previous step by following the steps [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/). 

   * You will need to check the http options to disable SSL certificate verification under `Tunnels -> Configure -> Public Hostname -> yourapplication.yourdomain -> Edit -> TLS Settings -> No TLS Verify` as the PiKVM uses self-signed certificates.

   * Don't skip the access policies as this important to preventing randoms from the internet from gaining access to your PiKVM. Cloudflare offers a variety of login options with the simplest being One-time PINs that are emailed to you. NOTE: This external authentication will not replace the username/password for the PiKVM but instead supplement it acting as a first line of defense from the internet.
  

## Installation on the PiKVM

1. Use these commands to install Cloudflared:

    ```
