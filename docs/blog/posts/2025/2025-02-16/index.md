At the request of Switch owners, we have improved the compatibility with DIY devices based on CSI bridge.

<!-- more -->

- Fixed the problem of the HDMI backpowering.
- Added compatibility mode if DIY PiKVM does not see the image through the switch.

As we promised, this is a new generation of multiport switches. It's so smart that we can fix any problems with it with a simple firmware update. No more "Oh crap, my <switch_vendor_here>" doesn't show any videos because of EDID ðŸ˜­ " Okay, okay, we just really proud of the design, sorry ðŸ™‚

- How to update: https://docs.pikvm.org/switch/#firmware-updating
- How to enable the fix: next to the update chapter.
