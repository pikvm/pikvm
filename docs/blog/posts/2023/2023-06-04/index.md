This is a performance update that improves multiple aspects of PiKVM OS.

<!-- more -->

- Added a new very effective mouse events protocol.
- Tuned some OS settings, so you will get a faster mass-storage image uploading.
- Actually, there are many more things that I have fixed and improved, but it's too boring to describe them.

To update:

```console
rw
pacman -Syu
reboot
```

We would appreciate wider testing. There are two important parameters in Web UI that affect the latency. Try them out:

- H.264 gop in the same location.
- Mouse polling interval in the System menu;

Try to reduce it to tis minimum values (0 and 10 ms respectively). This should reduce latency and increase responsiveness. If you don't have a very reliable network (you're using VPN, or your host is a thousand kilometers away from you)â€”check whether the mouse will work well and whether the video will not be interrupted often.

It is important for me to know this, because if everything is fine, I will change the default values. Let me know if you encounter any problems with the described parameters.
