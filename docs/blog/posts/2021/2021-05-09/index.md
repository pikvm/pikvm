If you bought an Ezcoo switch for USB 3.0, then in order for it to work with Pi-KVM, you need to upgrade to the new version and add one option to the config.

<!-- more -->

The fact is that the Ezcoo guys for some reason changed the management protocol. The update adds support for [this](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/blob/master/pages/ezcoo.md#additional-step-for-the-usb30-version).

Ah, and if you're wondering where the rest of the versions disappeared between release 2.59 and 2.65, then these were some things for the upcoming H.264 support ðŸ™‚

To update: 

```console
rw
pacman -Syu
reboot
```
