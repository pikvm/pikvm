There is good and bad news about our store.

<!-- more -->

A couple of days ago, we tried to make test sales and faced a huge number of refusals when making payments. In most cases, US and European banks consider the payment to Russia to be a fraudulent operation. There's nothing we can do about it. Well, it's probably well deserved, given the stories about Russian hackers.

Obviously, we can't sell our devices under these conditions, so we decided to sell most of the batch to wholesale suppliers in the US. These are two good stores that sell Raspberry Pi and accessories for them. The advantage of this approach is that it will be easier for you to buy it, if you want to add some things (Raspberry, memory card, cables, if you don't have one) and you will get delivery faster than from Russia. Minus - it will be a little more expensive.

The second batch will be sold through resellers for retail. To companies we will sell directly with deliveries via DHL.

So I'm doing customs clearance this week. Most likely, this will be delayed for another three weeks, taking into account the delivery to the reseller.
