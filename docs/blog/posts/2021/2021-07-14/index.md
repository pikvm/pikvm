For the Paste-as-Keys function, the state of the confirmation switch and the selected keymap are saved. You asked for itâ€”I did it.

Also, after solving the problems with HID on Apple, I sent patches to the upstream HID library. I know of at least one other project for which these problems were a thorn. Let's hope that we will make life easier for people ðŸ™‚

To update:

```console
rw
pacman -Syu
reboot 
```
