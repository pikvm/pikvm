We've been working on this for a long time! The new PiKVM V4 is even more powerful, more convenient and more feature-rich!

<!-- more -->

- We have **two new devices**—**V4 Mini** and **V4 Plus**. They have different hardware features.
- Both are based on **Compute Module 4**.
- Two new video modes support added: **1920×1080@60Hz** and **1920×1200@60Hz**. This improves the **UEFI/BIOS compatibility**.
- **V4 Mini has a fanless design** and efficient power consumption.
- **V4 Plus has a super-quiet cooling system** with a custom-designed heatsink and intelligent fan controller.
- Both devices are ready-made: **CM4 included, as well as a case, screen, and even micro SD**. Uh, and they are already assembled!

...and a lot of other nifty stuff ⚡
