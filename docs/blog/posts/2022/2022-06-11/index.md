For the happy owners of V2 and V3, we now offer a new utility, `kvmd-edidconf`. It will help you configure EDID (the display metadata) and provide import/export for EDID modification using advanced editors such as AW EDID Editor.

<!-- more -->

For example, with its help, you can easily change the manufacturer and model of the virtual display without external editor apps, if you want PiKVM to mimic real hardware:

```console
$ kvmd-edidconf --set-mfc-id=LNX --set-monitor-name=PiKVM
```
