# PiKVM V4 Mini & Plus quick start

![PiKVM V4 Mini & Plus](overview.jpg)

PiKVM is a feature-rich, production grade, open-source, Raspberry Pi based KVM over IP device. It allows you to turn on/off or restart your computer, configure the UEFI/BIOS, and even reinstall the OS using the Virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive.

You can use your remote keyboard and mouse or PiKVM can simulate a keyboard, mouse, and a monitor, which are then presented in a web browser as if you were working on a remote system directly.

## Wiring

### Network

![MISSING ETHERNET IMAGE](ethernet-connection.jpg)

Connect **Ethernet** (**bottom right** on the **front** side) to the network using the cable from the kit. The kit includes two Ethernet cables of different colors: one for the network, the second for ATX. Use whichever one you like best.

### HDMI

![MISSING HDMI IMAGE](hdmi-connection.jpg)

**HDMI input** (the **bottom right** on the **back** side) and **OTG** port (USB emulation) should be connected to the computer. Optionally, the **[ATX port](atx_board.md)** can be connected to control the power. There should be no USB hub between PiKVM and the computer, as some UEFI/BIOS cannot detect them at the boot stage.

### USB-C

TBD

## Power up

![MISSING POWER IMAGE](power-up.jpg)

Use the power supply and turn on PiKVM. The Mini comes with USB-C 5V power supply, and Plus with Barrel 12V. Use the appropriate connector on the **front** side. Please note that Plus can also work from 5V, in this case, do not connect a 12V power supply and don't create a significant power load on USB (external flash sticks, cameras, and so on).

**Do not** block the ventilation holes on the sides of the device. This is especially important for the V4 Plus, which has an active cooling.

Wait until PiKVM starts and shows a greeting on the built-in display. **Do not** turn off the device until it's fully booted for the first time.

## Update the OS

## Connect and set up

### Obtain IP address

### Connect via SSH

### Change the default passwords

### Open the web UI

### Connect to the target system

## Further steps

### Get to know the interface

Read [this help section](webui.md) to better understand all the possibilities of the web user interface.

### Set up Internet access

Configure access to PiKVM from the Internet using [port forwarding](https://docs.pikvm.org/port_forwarding) or [Tailscale VPN](https://docs.pikvm.org/tailscale).

### Set up ATX connection

[See here](atx_board.md).

### Configure audio

You can enable a microphone for two-way audio if you like. [See here](audio.md) for the guide.

### Networking options

- **Wi-Fi antenna**. The PiKVM V4 has a robust metal case that protects your device from physical damage and electromagnetic interference. Install an an external antenna to be able to use Wi-Fi. Follow [this guide](wifi.md).
- **LTE/5G modem**. With PiKVM V4 **Plus**, you can use the internal Mini-PCI and built-in SIM card slot to install a modem and thus create a portable solution or ensure the availability of the device for emergency access to the host. [See here](modem.md) for a detailed guide.

### USB 3.0 support

The V4 Plus has an internal USB port. It supports USB 3.0, but only works with USB 2.0 devices by default to minimize the power consumption. You need to flash the USB controller to enable USB 3.0. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and log into the PiKVM via SSH:

    ```console
    $ ssh user@host
    ```

2. Flash the USB controller using the built-in `flashrom` utility. Choose `usb3` for USB 3.0 support:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# flashrom-vl805 usb3
    ```

    If you need to disable USB 3.0 support at any time later, run the same command, but use `default` instead:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# flashrom-vl805 default
    ```

3. Perform the soft reboot:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# reboot
    ```

4. After the soft reboot, perform the **reboot by power**: unplug and plug again the power cable.

### HDMI pass-through

You can pass the signal from the host device to its physical display through V4 Plus. Only resolutions of up to 1080p are supported. [See here](pass.md) for the guide.

### DIP switches

There is a pair of DIP switches on the V4 right side. It is not recommended to change their state while the device is turned on.

| Right side |
|------------|
| <img src="plus_right.jpg" width="450" /> |

* The left switch **[1]**. When pulled down (**ON** state), the advanced backpower protection is used.
  On the default state is **OFF** (up), "diode protection" is used.
  This is required for debugging at the request of technical support. Under normal conditions, it is not necessary to change the mode.

* The right switch **[2]**. When pulled down (**ON** state), the Power Delivery chip is activated on the USB OTG port.
  The default state is **OFF** (up).

-----
## Known issues and limitations

* There may be compatibility issues with some motherboards, such as **HP** or **DELL**. If there is no image from the BIOS, you can fine-tune the HDMI settings, but it is possible that the Mass Storage devices will not be available in the BIOS. In the latter case, [USB dynamic configuration](usb.md) will solve the problem.
* While there is a Mini-PCIe slot in the V4 Plus, it was only designed for LTE modems. An NVME card will not work.
