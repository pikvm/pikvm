# PiKVM V4 Mini & Plus quick start

![PiKVM V4 Mini & Plus](overview.jpg)

PiKVM is a feature-rich, production grade, open-source, Raspberry Pi based KVM over IP device. It allows you to turn on/off or restart your computer, configure the UEFI/BIOS, and even reinstall the OS using the Virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive.

You can use your remote keyboard and mouse or PiKVM can simulate a keyboard, mouse, and a monitor, which are then presented in a web browser as if you were working on a remote system directly.

## Wiring

### Network

![MISSING ETHERNET IMAGE](ethernet-connection.jpg)

Connect **Ethernet** (**bottom right** on the **front** side) to the network using the cable from the kit. The kit includes two Ethernet cables of different colors: one for the network, the second for ATX. Use whichever one you like best.

### HDMI

![MISSING HDMI IMAGE](hdmi-connection.jpg)

**HDMI input** (the **bottom right** on the **back** side) and **OTG** port (USB emulation) should be connected to the computer. Optionally, the **[ATX port](atx_board.md)** can be connected to control the power. There should be no USB hub between PiKVM and the computer, as some UEFI/BIOS cannot detect them at the boot stage.

### USB-C

TBD

## Power up

![MISSING POWER IMAGE](power-up.jpg)

V4 Mini and V4 Plus have different power supplies:

- The Mini comes with USB-C 5V power supply
- The Plus comes with with Barrel 12V

The Plus can also work from 5V. In that case, avoid creating a significant power load on USB (external flash sticks, cameras, and so on).

Attach the appropriate connector on the **front** side. Do **not** block the ventilation holes on the sides of the device.

After turning on the power, PiKVM OS generates unique SSH keys and certificates and performs all necessary operations on the memory card. It takes a few minutes. Do **not** turn off the device until it's fully booted for the first time. Once it's done, the PiKVM will show a greeting on the built-in display.

## Connect and set up

### Access PiKVM

By default, PiKVM receives a dynamic IP address via DHCP and shows it on the OLED display. Let's assume that PiKVM has received the address `192.168.0.100` and has also been assigned a hostname `pikvm`.

Type the URL in the browser's address bar and press Enter: https://192.168.0.100/ or https://pikvm/.

![MISSING LOGIN SCREEN](log-in-form.png)

Submit the default credentials: use `admin` for both the user name and the password.

![MISSING LOGIN SCREEN](log-in-form.png)

You will see PiKVM's web user interface:

![MISSING WEBUI SCREEN](log-in-form.png)

### Change the default passwords

For security's sake, it's best to change the default passwords immediately after running PiKVM for the first time. To do that:

1. Open the web terminal

    ![MISSING SCREENSHOT](web-terminal.png)

2. Gain superuser privileges, use `root` for password:

    ```console
    $ su -
    ```

3. Run `rw` to change the access to the SD card to the write mode:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# rw
    ```

4. Change the password for the superuser:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# passwd root
    ```

5. Change the password for web access:

    ```console
    [root@pikvm ~]# kvmd-htpasswd set admin
    ```

6. Run `ro` to change the access to the SD card to the read-only mode:

### Access the remote system

1. Open your browser, go to https://<your-remote-access-url>, and log in using your credentials.

    ![Log into PiKVM remotely](logging-in.png)

2. Go to the "Video" tab.

    ![Log into PiKVM remotely](go-to-video-tab.png)

3. You should now see the host system's display and interact with it remotely using a keyboard and a mouse.

## Further steps

1. **Get to know PiKVM OS**: read [this help section](webui.md) to better understand all the possibilities of the web user interface.

2. **Update and customize the system**:

    - [Update](_update_os.md) the PiKVM operating system.
    - [Harden the remote access](auth.md) by enabling 2FA and setting session expiration time.
    - Configure access to PiKVM from the Internet using [port forwarding](port_forwarding.md) or [Tailscale VPN](tailscale.md).
    - Enable a microphone for [two-way audio](audio.md).
    - Enable [HDMI pass-through](pass.md).

3. **Configure hardware**:

    - Set up [ATX connection](atx_board.md).
    - Configure [DIP switches](dip_switches.md)
    - Install and set up [Wi-Fi antenna](wifi.md).
    - Install and set up [LTE/5G modem](modem.md) (**only for PiKVM V4 Plus**).
    - Set up [USB 3.0](usb3v4.md) (**only for PiKVM V4 Plus**).

## Known issues and limitations

* There may be compatibility issues with some motherboards, such as **HP** or **DELL**. If there is no image from the BIOS, you can fine-tune the HDMI settings, but it is possible that the Mass Storage devices will not be available in the BIOS. In the latter case, [USB dynamic configuration](usb.md) will solve the problem.
* While there is a Mini-PCIe slot in the V4 Plus, it was only designed for LTE modems. An NVME card will not work.
