!!! info "USB limitations"

    Each emulated USB device consumes a limited hardware resource called **endpoints**.

    Short info: by default, you can add only one additional USB device.

    To get more information about the endpoints, add more devices, and flexibly manage the configuration on the fly, see [here](usb.md).
