Please note that this is an unofficial library, so use it carefully.</p>"},{"location":"api/#authentication","title":"Authentication","text":"<p>All APIs are restricted to authentication. To make requests, you either need to auth each request individually, or get a token and pass it as a cookie with each request.</p> <p>With enabled 2FA, you will need to add the one-time code to the password without spaces. That is, if the password is <code>foobar</code> and the code is <code>123456</code>, then you need to use <code>foobar123456</code> as the password.</p> <p>The code can be generated using any TOTP library, for example in Python:</p> <pre><code>import requests\nimport pyotp\n\nuser = \"admin\"\npasswd = \"admin\"\nsecret = \"3OBBOGSJRYRBZH35PGXURM4CMWTH3WSU\"  # Can be found in /etc/kvmd/totp.secret\n\nprint(requests.get(\n    url=\"https://pikvm/api/info\",\n    verify=False,  # For self-signed SSL certificate\n    headers={\n        \"X-KVMD-User\": user,\n        \"X-KVMD-Passwd\": passwd + pyotp.TOTP(secret).now(),\n    },\n).text)\n</code></pre> <p>Since in the borderline case of the 2FA code lifetime, the code may be invalid, it makes sense to either handle error 403 by repeating the request in seconds.</p> <p>A more correct way is to combine this method and check the remaining lifetime and postpone the request if there is a second or so left. You can find out how much time is left in this way:</p> <pre><code>totp = pyotp.TOTP(secret)\nnow = int(time.time())\nremaining = now - (now % totp.interval)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api/#single-request-authentication","title":"Single-request authentication","text":"<p>There are two options here:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Using X-headers.

But it is here just so that you remember their existence.</p> Configuring PiKVM OS <p>Need more info? We have it!</p> <p>The following is a brief guide to configuring PiKVM. For more information (including the basics of YAML syntax and how to use a text editor in the Linux console), please refer to this page.</p> <p>Most of the PiKVM configuration files are located in the <code>/etc/kvmd</code> directory.</p> <p>The <code>/usr/lib/kvmd/main.yaml</code> file defines the platform configuration, and you should never edit it. To redefine system parameters use the file <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>. All other files that are also not recommended for editing have read-only permissions.</p> <p>You can also create several files with the <code>.*yaml</code> suffix and put then into <code>/etc/kvmd/override.d</code> directory to split your customization into logical parts. The <code>override.yaml</code> file definitions takes precedence over the <code>override.d</code> directory.</p> <p>A complete list of all parameters can be viewed using the <code>kvmd -m</code> command.</p> <p>Files with the <code>*.yaml</code> suffix uses the YAML syntax and describes a parameter tree with key-value pairs of different types. To define the parameters within one section, an indent of 4 spaces is used. Comments starts with the <code>#</code> symbol.</p> <p>Only 4 spaces should be used for indentation</p> <p>Be careful when editing YAML and follow this rule. Invalid indentation or tabs instead of spaces will cause an error when starting the services.</p> <p>Sections under the same keys should be merged:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Wrong:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    gpio:\n        drivers: ...\nkvmd:\n    gpio:\n        scheme: ...\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Correct:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    gpio:\n        drivers: ...\n        scheme: ...\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>In the <code>/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml</code> file you can specify some information regarding this PiKVM installation in an almost free YAML format.</p> Updating PiKVM OS <p>To update, run following commands under the <code>root</code> user:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# pikvm-update\n</code></pre> <p>If you encounter an error like:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# pikvm-update\nbash: pikvm-update: command not found\n</code></pre> <p>It's most likely you have an old OS release. You can update the OS as follows:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# rw\n[root@pikvm ~]# pacman -Syy\n[root@pikvm ~]# pacman -S pikvm-os-updater\n[root@pikvm ~]# pikvm-update\n</code></pre> <p>Next time you will be able to use the usual method with <code>pikvm-update</code>.</p> Connecting to PiKVM via SSH <p>SSH is the most common remote access method in the Linux world. Normally, it should be possible to simply run <code>ssh root@pikvm</code> in a terminal window to connect to your PiKVM. However, this can fail for various reasons. In that case, you will have to connect using PiKVM's IP address.</p> <p>To connect to PiKVM via SSH, do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Discover PiKVM's IP address in the local network. There are several ways to do that:</p> <ul> <li>Open the web interface of your router and find the list of issued IP addresses there.</li> <li>Linux-only: install and run arp-scan: <code>sudo arp-scan --localnet</code>.</li> <li>Linux, MacOS, Windows: Download and run Angry IP Scanner.</li> <li>Windows PowerShell: Use the <code>arp -a</code> command.</li> </ul> <p>In each case, look for the entry that says \"Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd\" and copy its IP address to the clipboard. Let's assume that the IP address is <code>192.168.0.100</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run the SSH client to connect to PiKVM:</p> <ul> <li>Linux, MacOS: Open any terminal application and run: <code>ssh root@192.168.0.100</code>.</li> <li>Windows: Use PuTTY for this.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Submit your <code>root</code> user credentials. The default password is <code>root</code>. If you haven't changed it, you absolutely should do it.</p> </li> <li> <p>You should now be able to see and interact with the serial port. All the system tools in PiKVM will be available in the terminal window. Once you are done, type <code>exit</code> and press Enter, or simply press Ctrl+d to terminate the session.</p> </li> </ol> Connecting to PiKVM via serial console <p>A serial console is a convenient and fast way to connect to PiKVM when there is no network, or get boot logs and a console if something goes wrong.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Connect to the physical universal asynchronous receiver / transmitter (UART) console from your host computer:</p> <ul> <li> <p>On PiKVM V3 or V4, you have a built-in USB-UART adapter in your device. Just disconnect the OTG cable and place the USB-C end into the <code>IOIOI</code> port on V4 (or the <code>CON</code> port on V3). Place the USB-A end into the port you want serial to be accessed, typically done on the host. If you have a Windows host, you may need to install this driver, other operating systems may not need one.</p> </li> <li> <p>On DIY PiKVM V1 or V2, you'll need to get the right TTY to USB cable, we recommend the RPi Debug Probe and follow existing RPi TTY serial setups.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Install <code>picocom</code> on a Linux or a macOS host (available in Homebrew and MacPorts), or Putty on Windows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identify the port that your operating system exposes for connecting to the PiKVM.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windows: look this up in the Device Manager</p> </li> <li> <p>Linux: open a terminal program, run <code>sudo dmesg | grep tty</code>and look for a message like this:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>[14362.388405] usb 1-2: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n</code></pre> <p>This means you will need to use <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.</p> <ul> <li>macOS: open the terminal and list all USB serial devices with <code>ls /dev/cu.usbserial-*</code>. Look for a device that contains <code>cu.usbserial</code>, e.g. <code>/dev/cu.usbserial-FT0RVWSW</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Connect via the serial port:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windows: select the COM port in Putty and use the 115200 baud rate, then connect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Linux/macOS: open your terminal program and run <code>sudo picocom -b 115200 $USB_SERIAL_DEVICE</code> where <code>$USB_SERIAL_DEVICE</code> is the device you looked up, e.g. <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> on Linux or <code>/dev/cu.usbserial-FT0RVWSW</code> on macOS.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After running the command, press Enter to get to a login prompt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit your root user credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p>You should now be able to see and interact with the serial port. All the system tools in PiKVM will be available in the terminal window. Once you are done, press Ctrl+a and then immediately Ctrl+x to terminate the session.</p> </li> </ol> Shutting down PiKVM <p>PiKVM defaults to using the system in read-only mode, so there is no need to explicitly shut it down. You can simply unplug the device from power.</p> <p>If you absolutely need to use the shutdown command, please ensure the following requirements are met:</p> <ul> <li>This is not one of the DIY (V1 or V2) devices. If you shut down a DIY PiKVM, it will not power on until you physically reconnect the power cord.</li> <li>You are not currently running a system update. If you are, you will likely corrupt the system.</li> <li>You are not currently uploading a mass storage drive image. If you are, you will likely corrupt the system.</li> </ul> <p>If all these requirements are met, do this:</p> <pre><code>[kvmd-webterm@pikvm ~]$ su -\n[root@pikvm ~]# shutdown -h now\n</code></pre> <p>PiKVM V3 and V4 will automatically reboot after several minutes of being halted. DIY PiKVM will need a power cord reconnection to become available again. </p>"},{"location":"cheatsheet/#getting-user-support","title":"Getting User Support","text":"<p>If something doesn't work, check out our FAQ.

Pi5 does not support hardware video encoding so there is no any reason to use it for PiKVM.</li> <li>RPi5 is not compatible with PiKVM V3 HAT due to the difference in form factor with RPi4.</li> </ul> Can I connect multiple servers to a single PiKVM? <p>Yes, but it requires additional work to set up. See this page.</p> How can I get the access to PiKVM in my local network over Internet? <p>You can use port forwarding for port 443 on your router if it has an external IP address. In all other cases, you can use the excellent free VPN service Tailscale, which can be configured on PiKVM with a few simple commands.</p> Can I assign a static IP to a PiKVM <p>Yes, we highly suggest using this document first for those that are not Linux savvy.</p> <p>[ONLY FOR ADVANCED LINUX USERS]</p> <p>Edit file <code>/etc/systemd/network/eth0.network</code> for Ethernet or <code>wlan0.network</code> for Wi-Fi and edit the <code>[Network]</code> section:</p> <pre><code>[Network]\nAddress=192.168.x.x/24\nGateway=192.168.x.x\nDNS=192.168.x.x\nDNS=192.168.x.x\n</code></pre> <p>Don't forget the <code>/24</code> suffix (CIDR), otherwise it will not work and your PiKVM will become unreachable.</p> How can I disable IPv6 on PiKVM? <p>To do this, you need at least KVMD 3.301 installed on your device. If this is not the case, update the OS.</p> <p>Next, append the <code>ipv6.disable=1</code> parameter to <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code> and perform <code>reboot</code>.</p> How do I recover my PiKVM, it cannot be reached now <ol> <li>Take the USB-C end cable you have for your target and move to the PiKVM IOIO port or CON port</li> <li>Take the USB-A end cable and put this on the HOST(The controlling PC)</li> <li>Turn on or reboot your PiKVM, you should now see a COMx port on your HOST PC</li> <li>Connect using something like Putty, use 115200 as your baud rate</li> <li>Edit the file using nano or whatever text editor you are comfortable with, save the file</li> <li>Reboot your PiKVM, check for functionality</li> <li>If still unreachable, edit the same file to fix it</li> <li>ONLY Disconnect the IOIO port once you have fully recovered your PiKVM and place this back onto the Target system</li> </ol> Can I use PiKVM for gaming? <p>No, because:</p> <ul> <li>For HDMI-CSI bridge, bus bandwidth is not enough to transmit more than 1080p50.</li> <li>For HDMI-USB dongle, high latency and low video quality.</li> <li>General hardware video capture differs from software streaming and introduces additional latency.</li> </ul> Can PiKVM do 4K video? <ul> <li>For HDMI-CSI bridge, no. There is not enough bandwidth in the CSI bus for that much data. 1080p50 will max out the bandwidth.</li> <li>For the USB capture devices: technically yes, they will down sample to something smaller to meet the USB 2.0 bandwidth limitations, so the source may be 4k, but the stream will not.</li> <li>The 4K real-time video will not fit through the network anyway.</li> </ul> Where does the cursor/video latency come from? <p>Here is the chain of transferring an image to your browser or VNC client.</p> <p><code>Capture device -&gt; Compression -&gt; Network -&gt; Decompression -&gt; Rendering</code></p> <p>100-200ms is very, very fast for this. But we are working to speed things up even more.</p> I am expecting to see 60fps and I am not, why? <p>PiKVM receives the entire signal, but then the encoding is the bottleneck. For 1080p, this is no more than 30 fps. V4 throws out every second frame of 60 hz/fps, and 30 fps is encoded. V3 and DIY can't process 60 hz and is only able to capture 50 hz, and in the same way they take every second frame, all you get out is 25 fps. The reason why V3 and DIY does not encode 30 out of 50 is that the picture will be jerky, but smooth at 25.</p> Does PiKVM support sound? <p>Yes but the only officially supported version is the PiKVM V3+ devices, V2 we will attempt best effort but ultimately we do not support CSI modules or USB.</p> Can I power the Pi via PoE? <p>Yes! </p> <p>For a POE HAT</p> <p>You still need a splitter to ensure you isolate the 5v connection between the Raspberry Pi and host PC to prevent back power issues that can cause instability or damage to either the host PC or the Pi. Power/Data cable + USB power blocker would work.</p> <p>For a POE Splitter</p> <p>No, there is no need for anything additional, you can power your RPi and or the PiKVM Mini with the USB-C variant.</p> Do I need a power splitter? Why do I need one? <ul> <li>Yes for RPi4 - Please see the main v2 document for splitter types listed under V2 hardware</li> <li>Yes for Zero W and Zero W 2, if using dedicated power you still need to split the power from the data towards the target. If using the target for power, this is not needed.</li> <li>This is not needed if you have a PiKVM V3 and V4, as they splits power and signal on the board.</li> </ul> Can I use PiKVM with non-Raspberry Pi boards (Orange, Nano, etc)? <p>Yes, but you will have to prepare the operating system yourself. For the PiKVM software, you will need to replace some config files (such as UDEV rules). If you are a developer or an experienced system administrator, you will not have any problems with this. In addition, we are open to patches. If you need help with this, please contact us via Discord (#unofficial_ports channel).</p> Is PiKVM OS its own custom distro? <p>No. PiKVM OS is an Arch Linux ARM with our own repository for KVM-related packages. We distribute OS images (that is, our Arch Linux ARM build) to simplify installation, since PiKVM requires some tuning of the OS and special partitioning of the memory card.</p> Why is PiKVM OS based on Arch Linux ARM and not Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS? <p>There are several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Several years ago, when PiKVM was just starting out, Raspbian didn't have a minimalistic image and the transition to systemd was in full swing, which is why the distribution was not too stable.</li> <li>Raspbian did not have all the necessary packages in the repositories to satisfy most software dependencies.</li> <li>PiKVM was born as a pet project, and the founder likes Arch the most.</li> </ul> <p>However, we plan to provide an alternative OS image based on Raspberry Pi OS in the future - now it is quite stable.</p> Can I use an iPad on PiKVM? <ul> <li>Yes, with the correct hardware you can control an iPad.</li> <li>In the opposite sense - yes, use VNC and use JUMP app (fully-featured but more expensive), or bVNC (cheap). RealVNC does NOT work.</li> </ul> How do I add my own SSL cert? <p>If you have a certificate (making a cert falls outside the scope of PiKVM - please reference OpenSSL documentation or use Let's Encrypt), replace keys in <code>/etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl</code>, edit <code>/etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl.conf</code> if necessary and restart <code>kvmd-nginx</code> service.</p> How do I emulate various USB devices on the target machine? <p>For a detailed description, see here.</p> <p>Use the following USB database to get the desired devices: https://the-sz.com/products/usbid or https://devicehunt.com.</p> Can I run a desktop on PiKVM? <p>Yes, but it's strongly not recommended OR supported as this OS should be used in read-only mode and it will need read-write enabled all of the time, however if you insist on running one, instructions are here.</p> How do I blank the oled screen? <p>Please run the following: </p><pre><code># systemctl disable --now kvmd-oled kvmd-oled-reboot kvmd-oled-shutdown\n# kvmd-oled --height=32 --interval=0 --clear-on-exit --text=x\n</code></pre> To re-enable the display: <pre><code># systemctl enable --now kvmd-oled kvmd-oled-reboot kvmd-oled-shutdown\n</code></pre> How do I rotate the OLED display? <p>Please run the following: </p><pre><code>1. mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/kvmd-oled.service.d\n2. Create file /etc/systemd/system/kvmd-oled.service.d/override.conf:\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/bin/kvmd-oled --height=32 --clear-on-exit --rotate=2\n</code></pre> I am getting a 500/503 error when I try and access the main KVM page! <p>This maybe due to a few of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Missing <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> file, to resolve it run <code>rw; touch /etc/kvmd/override.yaml; ro</code></li> <li>Bad YAML syntax, edit your <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> file and undo what you did and restart PiKVM.</li> </ul> How can I use the serial console to gain access to other devices <p>You need to stop the service which listens on the <code>/dev/ttyAMA0</code>:</p> <pre><code>rw\nsystemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service\n</code></pre> <p>If you want this change permanent (not starting again after reboot), you can disable this service, ('enable' to reverse this decision):</p> <pre><code>systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <ul> <li>Only USB OR the RJ-45 serial connector will work, you can't use them together!</li> <li>If you disable the service permanently, you can't recover your device via serial console if you need this.</li> <li>There are some reports, that you need to remove <code>ttyAMA0</code> from /boot/cmdline.txt, but this is not needed on new installations.</li> </ul> Can I run PiKVM in a docker? <p>No, technically it might be possible but the OS requires many specific settings that cannot be performed inside the container.</p> How can I change the HTTP/HTTPS ports? <p>To do this, you need at least KVMD 3.301 installed on your device. If this is not the case, update the OS.</p> <p>Add some of these lines to <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>:</p> <pre><code>nginx:\n    https:\n        port: 4430\n    http:\n        port: 8080\n</code></pre> <p>After that, restart the server: <code>systemctl restart kvmd-nginx</code>.</p> Can I control IR devices using PiKVM? <p>This goes far beyond the usual use of PiKVM, so there is no official way to do this, but there are some ways from the community that you can try if you know how to handle a soldering iron.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#first-steps","title":"First steps","text":"I can't find the PiKVM IP address in my network <p>Follow the device guide of your PiKVM here.</p> What is the default password? How do I change it? <p>See here.</p> How do I add another user? <p>See here.</p> How do I get root access in the web terminal? <p>See here.</p> Where is the PiKVM configuration located? <p>Almost all KVMD (the main daemon controlling PiKVM) configuration files are located in <code>/etc/kvmd</code>. You can also find nginx configs and SSL certificates there. KVMD configs use YAML syntax. The specific platform parameters can be found in the file <code>/etc/kvmd/main.yaml</code> and you should never edit it. Use <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> to redefine the system parameters.</p> <p>Files that are not recommended for editing have read-only permissions. If you edit any of these files, you will need to manually make changes to them when you upgrade your system. You can view the current configuration and all available KVMD parameters using the command <code>kvmd -m</code>.</p> I can't edit any file on PiKVM. Why is the system in read-only mode? <p>The PiKVM file system is always mounted in read-only mode. This measure prevents it from being damaged by a sudden power outage. To change the configuration you must first switch the filesystem to write mode using the command <code>rw</code> from root. After the changes, be sure to run the command <code>ro</code> to switch it back to read-only. If you get a message that the file system is busy, then the easiest way is to perform a <code>reboot</code>.</p> I want to get read-write filesystem all of the time <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>Seriously, DON'T. Read-only mode increases the life of the memory card and protects the filesystem from power loss failures.

Updating PiKVM OS <p>To update, run following commands under the <code>root</code> user:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# pikvm-update\n</code></pre> <p>If you encounter an error like:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# pikvm-update\nbash: pikvm-update: command not found\n</code></pre> <p>It's most likely you have an old OS release.

Otherwise you may get the error <code>SSL certificate problem: certificate is not yet valid</code></li> <li>It is recommended to update the OS before installing new packages (see the tip upper ^^^).</li> <li>Switch filesystem to RW-mode: <code>rw</code>.</li> <li>Find some packages (<code>emacs</code> for example): <code>pacman -Ss emacs</code>.</li> <li>Install it: <code>pacman -Syy</code> to update local packages list and <code>pacman -Su emacs</code> to install.</li> <li>Remove it: <code>pacman -R emacs</code>.</li> <li>Switch filesystem to RO-mode: <code>ro</code>.</li> </ul> I don't need ATX functions. How do I disable this in the Web UI? <p>If you don't need ATX power control you can disable the relevant Web UI menu in <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    atx:\n        type: disabled\n</code></pre> <p>... then restart <code>kvmd</code>:</p> <pre><code># systemctl restart kvmd\n</code></pre> How do I disable the web terminal? <pre><code># rw\n# systemctl disable --now kvmd-webterm\n# ro\n</code></pre> How do I completely disable authorization in PiKVM? <p>See here.</p> Can I have different hostnames for each of my PiKVMs? <p>Yes! And it's easy to do! Using a SSH session or the web terminal: * Make sure you are root, run <code>rw</code> then run <code>hostnamectl set-hostname yournewhostname.domain</code>. * Optional: edit <code>/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml</code> to alter the displayed hostname in the web UI. * Run <code>ro</code> and <code>reboot</code>.</p> Why not add software support for another codec? <p>Encoding is a heavy process and will add significant latency, its best to have hardware support to avoid additional latency.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#video-problems","title":"Video problems","text":"I can see the video but I can't see the WebRTC / video mode switch <p>WebRTC and Direct H.264 modes are only available on V2+ platforms with HDMI-CSI capture device, including PiKVM V3 or V4 Plus/Mini.

All you need to do is change the EDID data. This is the information about supported resolutions that the CSI bridge reports to your computer.</p> Glitchy or wrong BIOS/UEFI resolution <p>On some motherboards, the BIOS may be displayed at a lower resolution, or with some rendering issues/glitches, specially on newer ASUS ones. Like this:</p> <p></p> <p>This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options.</p> <p>If you can't or don't want to enable the CSM, you can try connecting a DisplayPort (DP) monitor, or a dummy plug. If you remove the DP cable/adapter the bug will reappear.</p> <p>If none of this works, try connecting the DP cable first, boot into the BIOS, disable the CSM and shutdown (do not restart) your PC. Then, boot into the BIOS and enable the CSM before shutting down your PC. Then connect the HDMI and turn your PC on again.</p> There is no video in GRUB2, but there is before and after <p>Sometimes this can be caused by the specifics of the BIOS/UEFI and how GRUB2 works with video.</p> <p>This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. The video mode will be located in the same section. Switch the Video mode from UEFI to Legacy.</p> Why does the CSI bridge does not work with official Raspberry Pi PoE HAT? <p>Details here. The reason is that the official HAT has a built-in fan controller that conflicts with the TC358743 chip of the bridge. The solution is to disable the fan control and connect the fan to the power line so that it works continuously. To turn off the controller you need to add the line <code>disable_poe_fan=1</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>.</p> The video freezes a few seconds after the start, restarting the Web UI or VNC does not help <p>The story is here. Very very rarely, Raspberry Pi boards can have a hardware defect that causes some of the chip blocks to be unstable under normal power. The solution is to slightly increase the power supply, as you would when overclocking. Add <code>over_voltage=1</code> (or <code>over_voltage=2</code> if previous doesn't help) to <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and perform <code>reboot</code>.</p> <p>To make sure that you are facing this particular problem, first perform a diagnostic:</p> <ul> <li>Boot the PiKVM without the specified options.</li> <li>Open Web-UI and wait for freezing.</li> <li>Click <code>System -&gt; Reset Stream</code>.</li> <li>Click <code>System -&gt; Open log</code> and make sure that the log contains messages like <code>H264: Can't wait for the VCOS semaphore</code>.</li> <li>Make sure that the last message from ustreamer was <code>H264: Configuring MMAL encoder</code> (not counting messages about connecting and disconnecting stream clients).</li> </ul> No image from computer with Linux + Awesome WM <p>Sometimes Awesome WM on Linux can't recognize a video output change on a cable. That is, if the cable was first inserted into the monitor, and then you reconnected it to PiKVM - it may happen that you will not see the image.

While tailscale will diligently request new certificates, it will fail to write it on the disk and hence will try to request new certificates next time you access your web server. Let's Encrypt has a limit of 5 certificates for the server per week, so you will end up with an inoperable server and rate-limited by Let's Encrypt for a day or so.</p> <p>Here's the command that allows you to seamlessly run HTTPS proxy for your PiKVM: </p><pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# tailscale serve --bg https+insecure://localhost:443\n</code></pre> And if you want to stop tailscale from serving HTTPS, you can do this by running: <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# tailscale serve --https=443 off\n````\n\n### Root cause\nTailscale needs to refresh TLS certificates and write state under `/var/lib/tailscale`.  \nOn PiKVM, the root filesystem is read-only, so direct writes fail.  \n\nWe can fix this by mounting an **ephemeral overlay filesystem (tmpfs) in RAM** for `/var/lib/tailscale`, backed by a persistent lowerdir (`/root/tailscale-state`).\n\nThis ensures that certificate rotation and state writes work without breaking PiKVM\u2019s read-only state.\n\n!!! warning\n    The **caveat** is that renewed certificates exist only in RAM. After a reboot, Tailscale falls back to the older certificates on disk, requests fresh ones, and stores them in RAM again.\n    If you reboot PiKVM too frequently, this can trigger Let's Encrypt's rate limits.\n\n### Solution\n\nCore idea:\n- Mount a **tmpfs** over Tailscale's state folder stored in root's home: /root/tailscale-state. \n- Mount the resulting *merged* layer onto the actual Tailscale state folder at /var/lib/tailscale.\n- An **overlayfs** will transparently present this folder to Tailscale, while changes are kept in the RAM-based overlay layer.\n\n**Note**: Overlayfs requires that the upperdir and workdir exist before creating the overlay.\nSince these directories live in RAM, they disappear after every reboot.\nThis means we cannot use fstab to declare the mount points.\nInstead, we implement this with a systemd service that runs a setup script during boot, before tailscaled starts.\n\n1. Switch filesystem to RW and copy Tailscale state:\n\n```console\n[root@pikvm ~]# rw\n[root@pikvm ~]# cp -a /var/lib/tailscale /root/tailscale-state\n````\n\n2.

For more information (including the basics of YAML syntax and how to use a text editor in the Linux console), please refer to this page.</p> <p>Most of the PiKVM configuration files are located in the <code>/etc/kvmd</code> directory.</p> <p>The <code>/usr/lib/kvmd/main.yaml</code> file defines the platform configuration, and you should never edit it. To redefine system parameters use the file <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>. All other files that are also not recommended for editing have read-only permissions.</p> <p>You can also create several files with the <code>.*yaml</code> suffix and put then into <code>/etc/kvmd/override.d</code> directory to split your customization into logical parts. The <code>override.yaml</code> file definitions takes precedence over the <code>override.d</code> directory.</p> <p>A complete list of all parameters can be viewed using the <code>kvmd -m</code> command.</p> <p>Files with the <code>*.yaml</code> suffix uses the YAML syntax and describes a parameter tree with key-value pairs of different types. To define the parameters within one section, an indent of 4 spaces is used. Comments starts with the <code>#</code> symbol.</p> <p>Only 4 spaces should be used for indentation</p> <p>Be careful when editing YAML and follow this rule. Invalid indentation or tabs instead of spaces will cause an error when starting the services.</p> <p>Sections under the same keys should be merged:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Wrong:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    gpio:\n        drivers: ...\nkvmd:\n    gpio:\n        scheme: ...\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Correct:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    gpio:\n        drivers: ...\n        scheme: ...\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>In the <code>/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml</code> file you can specify some information regarding this PiKVM installation in an almost free YAML format.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get to know PiKVM Web UI: read this help section to better understand all the possibilities of the web user interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set up ATX connection if you need to control the power of the remote system.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"v3/#further-recommendations","title":"Further recommendations","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Customize the system:</p> <ul> <li>Harden the remote access by enabling 2FA.</li> <li>Configure access to PiKVM from the Internet using port forwarding or Tailscale VPN.</li> <li>Enable a microphone for two-way audio.</li> <li>Learn how configuration files are structured.</li> <li>Read how PiKVM is identified on the target host.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Configure hardware:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you bought V3 HAT Assembly Kit and it includes the OLED display and/or the fan, you'll need to turn them on.

All other files that are also not recommended for editing have read-only permissions.</p> <p>You can also create several files with the <code>.*yaml</code> suffix and put then into <code>/etc/kvmd/override.d</code> directory to split your customization into logical parts. The <code>override.yaml</code> file definitions takes precedence over the <code>override.d</code> directory.</p> <p>A complete list of all parameters can be viewed using the <code>kvmd -m</code> command.</p> <p>Files with the <code>*.yaml</code> suffix uses the YAML syntax and describes a parameter tree with key-value pairs of different types. To define the parameters within one section, an indent of 4 spaces is used. Comments starts with the <code>#</code> symbol.</p> <p>Only 4 spaces should be used for indentation</p> <p>Be careful when editing YAML and follow this rule.

This was replaced by the character device <code>/dev/gpiochipX</code>.</p> <p>It is stated that the old interface will be removed in 2020, that is, very soon. Existing GPIO libraries for Python and C will also stop working: RPi.GPIO, pigpio, wiringpi and other. </p> <p>It seems that the coming year will be fun for many projects that use the old library. For this reason, I got rid of RPi.GPIO and now KVMD uses libgpiod, a library for working with GPIO recommended and supported by kernel developers.</p> <p>GPIO changes will not affect those who simply use this to control the ATX or control the KVM switch. However, those who use custom GPIO in Pi-KVM should know that it is no longer possible to save the pin state for GPIO (this is the kernel limitation) using option <code>initial=null</code>.

I spent a few days debugging this problem and now it is solved in the Raspbian upstream.</p> </li> <li> <p>The kernel update is also unlocked for ZeroW boards.

Also added support for the NonUs and AltGr keys, fixed Win key in VNC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implemented basic support for Redfish as an improved and secure IPMI replacement for enterprise use (see here for documentation. Redfish requires no additional configuration and is available directly in KVMD. It uses the same authorization mechanism as the rest of the Pi-KVM. The only handle available /redfish/v1 without authorization produces a small static document for service discovery required by standard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Added the ability to request confirmation for actions on custom GPIO buttons and switches (see View rules).</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you can create USB Ethernet for direct communication between the Pi-KVM and the server (see here for more information).

It contained some Python-specific logging settings that no one had ever changed. Getting rid of this artifact will simplify the configuration structure for some future improvements.</p> </li> <li> <p>We have deprecated <code>/etc/kvmd/auth.yaml</code>. This is a legacy auth configuration that existed before <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> was introduced, and has never been suggested for use even in the documentation. If you have ever customized your PiKVM with <code>auth.yaml</code> (likely not), your changes will be carefully moved to <code>/etc/kvmd/override.d/...</code>, and the source file is <code>auth.yaml</code> should be deleted manually. Please see here for details.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>!include</code> directive in <code>/etc/kvmd/override*</code> and <code>/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml</code> configs is now deprecated and removed. Instead, you can place your partial config files into the <code>/etc/kvmd/override.d</code> directory, which is described in the documentation. Automatic migration is not possible here, and if you used <code>!include</code> for some reason, <code>pikvm-update</code> will tell you to remove this from the configuration before updating.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Please note that if you stored all the configs only in <code>override.d</code> and <code>override.yaml</code> and did not use <code>!include</code>, the migration will be transparent for you.</p>"},{"location":"stl/atx/","title":"PiKVM v3 ATX mounting brackets for 3D printing","text":""},{"location":"stl/atx/#pikvm-v3-atx-mounting-brackets-for-3d-printing","title":"PiKVM v3 ATX mounting brackets for 3D printing","text":"<p>A good way to mount an ATX adapter in a computer case is to place it in a PCI slot.
